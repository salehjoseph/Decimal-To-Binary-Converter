# Decimal to Binary Converter - Learn Recursion by Building

Welcome to the **Decimal to Binary Converter** project! This project was completed as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of recursion, a core programming concept that allows functions to call themselves. By working on this project, I aimed to simplify the complex problem of converting decimal numbers to binary by breaking it down into smaller, manageable sub-problems, until they became easy to solve.

## Project Overview

Recursion is a powerful concept in programming that can help reduce the complexity of certain problems by allowing a function to call itself. In this project, I built a **Decimal to Binary Converter** using JavaScript, which not only solidified my understanding of recursion but also gave me hands-on experience with the call stack and how recursion is executed under the hood.

### What I Learned

- **Recursion Fundamentals**: I delved deep into how recursion works and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems.
- **Call Stack Exploration**: I explored how the call stack operates during recursive function calls, giving me a clearer understanding of how memory is managed.
- **Visual Representation**: I created an animation that visually represents the recursion process, helping to break down the concept for easier understanding.

## Features

- **Decimal to Binary Conversion**: The core feature of this project is converting a decimal number to its binary equivalent using a recursive approach.
- **Interactive Animation**: A visual representation of the recursion process, making it easier to understand how recursion works step by step.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decimal-to-binary-converter.git
cd decimal-to-binary-converter
